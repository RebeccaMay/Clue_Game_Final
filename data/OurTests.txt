For the testRooms() test, we decided to test all of the rooms and their corresponding charachters rather than a few. For FourDoorDirections() we modified things extensively. Our layout has rooms with multiple "doors" next to each other, such as the entrance to the Ring Toss. So in addition to testing doors from all directions, we also made sure the doors next to each other were also valid.	For this, the hay ride has doors opening to the RIGHT, the petting zoo has a LEFT door, the ring toss has 4 UP doors, and the corn maze has 2 DOWN doors. We also selected cells within rooms that weren't doors, and tested for that.

The cell locations in testRoomInitials() were chosen according to the layout, and are supposed to have the corresponding character associated with them, and that is what's tested.

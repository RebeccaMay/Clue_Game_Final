Test Descriptions:
For the testRooms function we simply had the same code except for our building names and initials
are different from Cyndi's tests.

Our testBoardDimensions function is the same except the constants NUM_ROWS, and NUM_COLUMNS are defined 
as 21, and 23 respectively in our setUp function.

The FourDoorDirections code is the same except for our door locations are different from Cindy's because
our doors are different from hers.  An example is our down door occurs at location (7, 3) where as her's
occurs at (4, 3).

The testNumberOfDoorways function is different because we have 13 instead of 16 doors.

The testRoomInitials function in our test tests all of the rooms in different corners and along the edges
of the board as well.  Obviously this involves different cells from the amazing CR's code.
